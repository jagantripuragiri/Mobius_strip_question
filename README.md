# Mobius_strip_Backendintern_Task


Structure :


MobiusStrip is the main class.

Initializes a 3D grid using the given parametric equations.
Computes surface area using vector calculus-based integration (cross product of partial derivatives).
Approximates edge length by evaluating both edges (v = ±w/2) and summing segment distances.

Surface Area Approximation Calculated using:

Edge Length :

Approximated by evaluating points on the boundary (v = ±w/2).
Euclidean distance summed between successive edge points.


Challenges :

Handling gradient accuracy at high resolutions.
Visualizing non-orientable surface without confusing perspective.
Ensuring area integration converges by balancing resolution n.
